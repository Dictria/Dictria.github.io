## 01-A Hello CMake

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
```

* Minimum CMake version

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)
```

* Projects: function `project()` will create a variable `${PROJECT_NAME}` with the value `hello_make`

```cmake
project(hello_cmake)
```

* Create an executable. The `add_executable()` command specifies that an executable shoule be build from the specified source files.
  * `hello_cmake`: the name of executable
  * `main.cpp`: the list of source files to compile

```cmake
add_executable(hello_cmake main.cpp)
```

same as:   

```cmake
add_executable(${PEOJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
```

## 01-B Hello Header

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── Hello.h
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

* Directory Path variables

|         Variables         |                             Info                             |
| :-----------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|     CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR      |                  The root source directory                   |
| CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR  | The current source directory if using sub-projects and directories |
|    PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR     |      The source directory of the current cmake project       |
|     CMAKE_BINARY_DIR      | The root binary/build directory. This is the directory when you ran the cmake command |
| CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY__DIR |            The build directory you are current in            |
|    PROJECT_BINARY_DIR     |         The build directory for the current project          |

* Source files variable: Creating a variable include the source files.    

```cpp
set(SOURCES src/hello.cpp src/main.cpp)
add_execuable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCE})
```

Wildcard pattern matching:    

```cpp
file(GLOB SOURCE "src/*.cpp")
```


* Including Directories: When you have different include folders, you can make your compiler aware of them using the `target_include_directories()` function. When compiling this target, this will add directories to the compiler with the `-I` flag.   

```cmake
target_include_directories(target PRIVATE ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
```

* Verbose Output

```make
make VERBOSE=1
```

## 01-C Static Library

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── static
│       └── Hello.h
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```


* Adding a Static Library: The `add_library()` function is used to create a library from some source files

```cmake
add_library(hello_library STATIC src/Hello.cpp)
```

This will be used to create a static library with the name `libhello_library.a` with the sources in the `add_library` call.

* Populating Including Directories

```cmake
target_include_directories(hello_library PUBLIC ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
```

The meaning of scope are:   

|   Scope   |                           Meaning                            |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|  PRIVATE  | the directories is added to this target's include directories |
| INTERFACE | the directories is added to the include directories for any targets that link this library |
|  PUBLIC   | the directories is added to the target's include directories and any targeta that link this library |

* Linking a Library: When creating an executable that will use your library, you must tell the compiler about the library.

```cmake
add_eexecutable(hello_binary src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(hello_binary PRIVATE hello_library)
```

This tells CMake to linke the hello_library against the hello_binary executable during link time. It will also propagate any include directories with PUBLIC and INTERFACE scope from the linked library target.

## 01-D Shared Library

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── shared
│       └── Hello.h
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

* Adding a Shared Library

```cmake
add_library(hello_library SHARED src/Hello.cpp)
```

This will be used to create a shared library with the name `libhello_library.so` with the sources passed to the `add_library()`.    

* Alias Target

```cmake
add_library(hello::library ALIAS hello_library)
```

This allows you to reference the target using the alias name when linking it against other targets.   

* Linking a Shared Library

```cmake
add_executable(hello_binary src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(hello_binary PRIVATE hello::library)
```


## 01-E Installing (TODO)

```
├── cmake-examples.conf
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── installing
│       └── Hello.h
├── README.adoc
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

## 01-F Build Type

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
```

* CMake has a number of built in build configuration which can be used to compile your project. These specify the optimization levels and if debug information is to be included in the binary. The levels provided are:

|     Level      |                 Description                  |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------: |
|    Release     | Add the `-O3 -DNDEBUG` flags to the compiler |
|     Debug      |              Add the `-g flag`               |
|   MinSizeRel   |              Add `-Os -DNDEBUG`              |
| RelWithDebInfo |         Add `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG` flags          |

* Set Build Type: The build type can be set using:

```cmake
cmanke .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## 01-G Compile Flags

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
```

* CMake supports setting compile flags in a number of different ways:
  1. using `target_compile_difinitions()` function.  
  2. using the `CMAKE_C_FLAG` and `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` variables

* Set Per-Target C++ Flags

```cmake
target_compile_definitions(cmake_examples_compile_flags PPRIVATE EX3)
```

This will cause the compiler to add the definition `-DEX3` when compiling the target.   
If the target was a library and the scope PUBLIC or INTERFACE has been chosen the difinition would also be included in any executable that link this target.   

* Set Default C++ Flags: The default `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` is either empty or contains the appropriate flags for the build type. To set additional default compile flags, you can add the following to the top level CMakeLlists.txt:  

```cmake
set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -DEX2" CACHE STRING "Set C++ Compiler Flags" 
```

Similarly to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS other options include: `CMAKE_C_FLAG`, `CMAKE_LINKER_FLAGS`   
The value `CACHE STRING "Set C++ Compiler Flags" FORCE` are used to force the variable to be set in the CMakeCache.txt


## 01-H Third Party Library

```cmake
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
```

* Nearly all non-trivial project will have a requirement for including third party libraries, headers, programs. CMake has support for finding the path to these tools using the `find_package()` function. This will search for CMake modules in the format `"FindXXX.cmake"` from the list of folders in `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. On linux the default search path will include `/usr/share/cmake/Modules`.   

* Find a Package: 

```cmake
find_package(Boost 1.46.1 REQUIRED COMPONENTS filesystem system)
```

arguments:   

  * Boost: Name of the library
  * 1.46.1: The minimum version of boost to find
  * REQUIRED: Tells the module that this is required and to fail if it can  not found.
  * COMPOENTS: The list of components to find in the library.

* Checkong if the package is found: Most included packages will set a variable `XXX_FOUND` 

```cmake
if(Boost_FOUND)
    message("noost found")
    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}
else()
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Cannot find Boost")
endif()
```

* Export Variables: After a package is found, it wll often export variables which can inform the user where to find the library, header or executable files. Similar to `XXX_FOUND` variable, these are oacjage specific and are typically documented at the top of the `FindXXX.cmake` file.   
  * The variables exported in this example include:
    * `Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS`: The path to boost header files.
