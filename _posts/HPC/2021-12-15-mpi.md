## 1. MPI Outline
```cpp
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    //Initialize MPI environment
    MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
    
    //Get the number of processes
    int world_size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);

    //Get rank of the process
    int world_rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);

    //Get the name of the processor
    char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
    int name_len;
    MPI_Get_proocessor_name(processor_name, &name_len);

    printf("Hello world from processor %s, rank %d out of %d processors\n", processor_name, world_rank, world_size);

    MPI_Finalize();

    return 0;
}
```
* MPI environment must be initialized with: 
```cpp
MPI_init(int* argc, char** argv);
```
  * During this process, all of MPI's global and internal variables are constructed. 
  * `MPI_Init()` takes two arguments that are **not necessary**. And extra parameters are simply left as extra space in case future implementation might need them. 

* There are two functions are used in almost every MPI program
```cpp
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_Comm communicator, int* size);
```
`MPI_Comm_size`: Return the size of a communicator. In the example, `MPI_COMM_WORLD`(constructed by MPI) encloses all of the processes in the job, so this call should return the amount of processes that were requested for the job.    

```cpp
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_Comm communicator, int* rank);
```
`MPI_Comm_rank` returns the rank of a process in a communicator. Each process inside of a communicator is assiged an incremental rank starting from zero which are used for identification purpose when sending and receiving message.   

* a less-used fuction in the program   
```cpp
MPI_Get_processor_name(char* name, int* name_length);
```
`MPI_Get_processor_name()` obtains the actual name of the processor on which the process is executing.

* the final call in the program is:   
```cpp
MPI_Finalize();
```
`MPI_Finalize()` is used to clean up the MPI environment. **No more MPI call can be made after this function.**    

### Running the MPI sample
```c
mpicc -o mpi_hello_world mpi_hello_world.c
mpic++ -o mpi_test mpi_test.cpp
//specify the number of process
mpirun -n 4 ./mpi_hello_world
```
